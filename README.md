Hi, I’m Genie James Arsenal! I’m currently a college student pursuing a Bachelor’s in Information Technology. Alongside my studies, I work as a graphics designer and have experience in front-end development and UI design. You can reach me on Facebook at Genie Arsenal. A fun fact about me: I’m a shy person, but I’m also friendly and have a “deadly” side when it comes to my creativity!
